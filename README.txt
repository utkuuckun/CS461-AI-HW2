1. If there are no referenced libraries, in order to be able to tun this project, you have to externally add the jar files which are located on the lib file to the project. One way to do it on Eclipse is  after a right click on the project Build Path>Add External Archives>Everything on the lib file. 
2. If the edges are not easy to see, one can comment this exact line: graph.setCellsSelectable(false); 
in Graph.java to be able to select and move the edges to see clearly.
